📊 RFM Customer Segmentation

A Python‑based project demonstrating RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation using transactional data. This repository includes interactive Jupyter notebooks that guide you through computing RFM metrics, interpreting customer segments, and extracting insights from customer purchase behavior.

RFM analysis is widely used in marketing analytics to identify valuable customer segments and inform targeted retention or engagement strategies.

🧠 What Is RFM Analysis?

RFM analysis is a data‑driven technique used to evaluate customer value based on three behavioral metrics:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency (F): How often they make purchases

Monetary (M): How much money they spend

By scoring and combining these metrics, customers can be grouped into meaningful segments (e.g., Champions, Loyal, At Risk) that help businesses tailor messaging, promotions, and retention strategies.
